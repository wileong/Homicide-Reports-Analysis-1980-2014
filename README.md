# homicide_reports_analysis_1980-2014

Used [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) with Scala to assist with analyzing a large FBI data set over a distributed system.

TemperatureAndHomicides reduces the main FBI data set to smaller data sets to display the correlation between temperature and homicide rates,  and cases where the perpetrator was younger than ten years old.

HomicideSolveRatesByCity gets the percentages of homicide cases solved for select U.S. cities.
